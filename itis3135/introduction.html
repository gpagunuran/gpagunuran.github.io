            <li><b>Personal Background: </b>I was born in New Brunswick, NJ, but I spent most of my life in Concord, NC. I still live in Concord with my parents. </li>
            <li><b>Academic Background: </b> I went to Cox Mill Elementary, Harris Road Middle, and Cox Mill High school. I started my college career in Appalachian State University studying music production, moved to CPCC for financial reasons, then changed my major to Computer Science and eventually ended up pursuing a degree closer to home in UNCC.</li>
            <li><b>Courses I'm Taking & Why</b>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>MATH1242 - Calculus 2: </b>This is required for my major, but I am interested in continuing my math studies to work towards a math minor.</li>
                    <li><b>ITSC3146 - Intro to Operating Sys. & Networking</b> I am very interested in operating systems. I would like what I learn in this class to create some personal projects.</li>
                    <li><b>ITIS3200 - Intro to Info Security and Privacy: </b>This class very closely relates to one of my dream occupations: creating and maintaining cybersecurity measures for a public database, like online libraries.</li>
                    <li><b>ITIS3135 - Front-End Web App Development: </b>I  figure that concepts in this course are essential to know for anyone that wants to create a nice portfolio for computer science.</li>
