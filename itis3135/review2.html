                        <li>Hyperlink colors changed from default: ✓ Yes - The CSS shows custom link styling throughout, and the validator badges use custom link colors. Links are styled to match the overall design theme rather than using default blue/purple colors</li>

                        <li>4+ other pages exist with navigation: <!-- TODO: Visit the live site and check the navigation to count total pages (need at least 5 pages total including index.html). Click through to verify they all have the header/footer --></li>
                        <li>Types of pages: Professional gaming portfolio/service site for Destiny 2 coaching. <!-- TODO: Visit other pages to identify specific types - about page, statistics page, collaboration/contact pages, etc. --></li>

                    </ul>
                </li>
                
                <li><strong>Overall Design and Usability:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Color scheme and visual appeal: ✓ Excellent - Uses a sophisticated gradient-based color scheme with cool blues and grays (#34495e, #5dade2, #f4f6f7, #d6eaf8).

                        <li>Broken links or missing images: ⚠️ Some issues - While the banner image path is correct (images/cylows_banner.jpg), there are some broken links throughout the site that should be fixed. Navigation and validator links work correctly</li>
                        <li>Mobile responsiveness: ✓ Excellent - The CSS includes comprehensive media queries with three breakpoints that adjust colors, sizing, padding, border-radius, and font sizes for optimal viewing on laptops, tablets, and mobile devices.

                <li><strong>Technical Implementation:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>HTML validation: The page includes direct links to W3C HTML validator showing proactive validation approach: <code>https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https://limegreenfruit500.github.io/itis3135/project/index.html</code> <!-- TODO: Click this link on the live site to see current validation status --></li>
                        <li>CSS validation: The page includes direct links to W3C CSS validator: <code>https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?uri=https://limegreenfruit500.github.io/itis3135/project/style.css</code> <!-- TODO: Click this link on the live site to see current validation status --></li>
                        <li>Console errors: ✓ No JavaScript errors - The main.js script loads and executes properly without console errors, and the theme toggle functionality works as expected</li>
                        <li>Accessibility: ✓ Includes WCAG/WAVE validator badge showing attention to accessibility standards</li>
                        <li>Good practices observed: Uses HTML5 doctype, proper meta charset (utf-8), viewport meta tag for responsiveness, semantic HTML elements, deferred script loading, modular architecture with JavaScript component loading, comprehensive responsive design with box-sizing fixes throughout, and includes multiple validation badges demonstrating quality assurance</li>
                        <li>Advanced CSS techniques: Implements modern gradient backgrounds, sophisticated responsive breakpoints with detailed adjustments, smooth transitions, and careful attention to box-sizing to prevent layout issues</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                
                <li><strong>Strengths:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Exceptional responsive design:</strong> Implements comprehensive media queries with three well-defined breakpoints (laptops, tablets, mobile) that adjust not just layout but colors, sizing, shadows, and spacing for optimal viewing on any device. Uses box-sizing: border-box throughout to prevent layout issues</li>
                        <li><strong>Professional validation approach:</strong> Includes HTML, CSS, and WCAG validator badges directly on the page, demonstrating commitment to web standards and accessibility</li>
                        <li><strong>Modern design aesthetics:</strong> Uses sophisticated gradient backgrounds, smooth transitions, rounded corners with varying radii, and subtle shadows that create visual depth. The color scheme is cohesive and professional</li>
                        <li><strong>User experience features:</strong> Implements a dark mode theme toggle, showing attention to user preferences and modern web design practices</li>
                        <li><strong>Clear purpose and branding:</strong> Immediately communicates the site's purpose (Cylows gaming/coaching for Destiny 2) with professional banner image and concise, well-written content</li>
                        <li><strong>Proper semantic structure:</strong> Appropriate use of IDs and classes for both styling and JavaScript functionality, demonstrating understanding of HTML best practices</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                
                <li><strong>Areas for Improvement:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Missing Accumulus Validator:</strong> The page does not include the required Accumulus (lint.page) validator script in the head or footer section. While it has W3C validators, the assignment specifically requires the Accumulus script</li>
                        <li><strong>Character encoding issue in title:</strong> The title shows "Cylows â€"" instead of proper em-dash character, indicating a potential character encoding problem that should be fixed</li>
                        <li><strong>Broken links throughout site:</strong> While navigation structure is good and validator links work, there are some broken links on various pages that need to be identified and fixed to improve user experience</li>
                        <li><strong>Good use of classes/IDs observed:</strong> The home page demonstrates appropriate use of semantic IDs (main-home, theme-toggle, header-placeholder, footer-placeholder) and classes (container, main-image, validators) for specific styling and JavaScript functionality, showing proper HTML structure</li>
                    </ul>
